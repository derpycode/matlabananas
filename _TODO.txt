=== GENERAL ===

MORE ON THE MATLAB GUI
how to use the RUN button
how not to use this for functions (=> wrape the function up in a nother m-file (script file) and then RUN)

*** more generic, less sciency example ***
*** more statistics and curve-fitting etc stuff early on ***
*** more step-by-step instructions ***
*** clearer/more code outline figures/schematics ***
*** more comprehensive, clearer, and coherent, graphics and graphics editing section ***

reationalize number of grid examples

add some 3D visualization?
viewing angles, slices of data, etc
surfaces

=== CHAPTER 0 ===


=== CHAPTER 1 [intro to MATLAB] ===

Process bathy data and create histograms
create hyp[sometric curve
combine with sea-level(!) to create shelf area(?) (here, or a different chapter?)

REVISE the earthquake stuff ... is this really a good example? 
What is it for or illustrating.

=== CHAPTER 3 [intro to programming: loops and conditions] ===

=> need CO2 data in better 'format' so that different proxies cannbe plotted in different colors
object? or create seperate file of data type?
-> show how to convert strings to numbers, but supply number coded data to lean in (now 5, rather than 4, columns)

=== CHAPTER 4 [algorithms] ===

CREATE:

\section{Subroutines and structured programming}

=== CHAPTER 5 [GUIs] ===

CREATE:

\section{Further helpings of GUI}

=== CHAPTER x [more MATLAB and plotting] ===

textscan ... example not great and needs revision
ADD read/write ('r'/'w') specifiers

In basic plotting -- add blocky plot
* add blocky example of '3D' / gridded data plotting
(use bathymetry example)

* add new histogram examples and processing of bathymetry data
* add details for plotting 2 different y-axes
* add details of color bars and labelling   

EXAMPLES: ice-core data ... introduce re-sampling (interpolation) (use calculating a mean value as an example)
(and as an example of calculating a mean and sample spacing, create a square wave with unequal sampling)

=== CHAPTER x ===

* example of processing bathy data -- find gradients (i.e. steapness)
--> simpe for the global grid (divie into 2 diections and difference the whole arrays)
--> more complex if ocean is to me omitted
(NaN the ocean and do 2 arrays, or loop and rtest for ocean)

* illustrate differnt search algorithms

=== CHAPTER x ===

move 1-D EBm to after the CH4 model example
hence add optimization to the EBM but keep the CH4 model sinmpler!

=== CHAPTER x ===

add lake system as an example of using inverse matrix methods to solve equations
[NEEDS A BIG RE-WRITE]

EBM: add schematic of area capturing energy vs. total area? 
add in units check/balance to illustrate equation for calculating delta-T
(mention years -> seconds)
